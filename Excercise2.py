"""
Count the number of integers in a list, starting with 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 respectively.

the total number of integers in that list is 100000 and the range: 0 to 1000000000

Store all the counters in a suitable data structure

Use Minimal lines of code to make the program efficient.

the code to obtain the list of integers are given below:

list1 = []
import random
for i in range(0,100000):
   list1.append(random.randint(0,1000000000)
