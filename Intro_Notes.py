String Operations

1. Concatentation

    add two or more strings to make a new string

    E.g.) "Hello" + " " + "World" = "Hello World"

2. Slicing

    Strings are a list of characters

    if you want to extract a certain part of a string

    E.g.) var = "Hello"

            len(var) = 5 # Read as {index:char} : {0:H,1:e,2:l,3:l:4:o}

            var[2:4] = ll # it extract all characters between index position 2(including) and 4(not inclusive) in "Hello"
"""

"""
Lists + List Operations

-> lits, similar to strings have different indices(positions) where elements are stored

Basic list functions:
    -> Len
    -> sort
    -> max
    -> min
    
E.g.)
    list_1 = [1,4,3,2]
    len(list_1) = 4
    sort(list_1) => [1,2,3,4]
    max(list_1) => 4
    min(list_1) => 1

in Python, the indices(positon#s) in a list start with 0, so the first position in a list has an index value of 0:
    E.g.) list_1[0] = 1

similarly the last element in a list has an index number of len(list)-1
    E.g) list1 = [1,2,3,4]
        in list1, 1 is in 0th index, 2 in 1st index, 3 in 2nd index, 4 in the 3rd index (But length of the list is 4 because there are 4 elements)
